myContacts:
To get different ways of transportation when asking for directions, please choose a new mode of transportation,
click go, and allow access to your location again.

Please note, for the nearby search, if there are none of the location type within the current zoom of the map, please zoom out or 
move the map around. 

Changes from initial version that I turned in first:
	I have the nearby searching now centered around the users current location instead of just the UMN coordinates.
