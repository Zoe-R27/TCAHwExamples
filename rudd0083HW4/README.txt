HW4

Just like in the EchoServer.py file, to change the port, you have to do python3 rudd0083.py -p [port number]

The default port for the redirect is 9001

I have included my files for css, js, and img

Also, files from HW3 are named myContacts.html, myForms.html, and myWidgets.html

I did do the extra credit
